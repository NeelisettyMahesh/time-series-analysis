# Time Series ANALYSIS

## Project Overview
This project forecasts NSEI stock closing prices (2015-2023) using ARIMA and SARIMA models. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, time series decomposition, model training, forecasting, and error evaluation.

## Data Source
- Dataset: `NSEI 2015-2023.csv`  
- Contains daily closing prices, adjusted for business days and missing values.

## Requirements
- pandas
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn

## Installation

## Usage
- Place the CSV dataset in the project directory.
- Run the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook to:
  - Load and preprocess data
  - Visualize time series and decomposition
  - Train ARIMA and SARIMA models
  - Forecast stock prices for 2023
  - Plot and evaluate predictions using MSE.

## Notes
- Warnings about parameter initialization during SARIMA fitting are normal.
- No Prophet model included in this version.
- Adjust model parameters as needed for better accuracy.
